All python programs were used for visualisations.

The following programs were used to construct images or GIFs to support my thesis:
- Area scan camera real rotor
- Line scan camera
- Conveyor_belt_visualisation
- Encoder

the "Visualise_demonstrator_with_arduino_input" program was used to display information about the demonstrator setup in real-time.
