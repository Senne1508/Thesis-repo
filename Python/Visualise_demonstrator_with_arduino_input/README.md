Libraries needed:
- serial
- Pygame

This code is similar to the "Conveyor_belt_visualisation" code, the difference being that this code uses the physical encoder as an input, and shows the desired brighness and trigger frequency in real time.

In order for this code to work, the Arduino must be coupled to the PC and sent out speed data.
