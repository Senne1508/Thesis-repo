# Master's thesis Senne DaniÃ«ls

This repository contains code written during my master's thesis titled "Obtaining consistent images on variable-speed conveyor belt using a line scan camera".

This repository is divided into three parts, according to the program in which the code was written:
- Python: Python was used to construct images or videos to clarify concepts handled in my thesis. As well as code to display information in real time.
- Arduino: this folder contains all code written for the Arduino, including code to convert encoder inputs to speed, code to control the line light through TCP-IP using an ethernet shield, and code that uses the encoder input to control the line light.
- MATLAB: simulations were made regarding control and illumination methods.
